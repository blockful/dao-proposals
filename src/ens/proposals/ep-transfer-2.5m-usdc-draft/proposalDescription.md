# [EP #] [Executable] Transfer $2.5M USDC from Endowment to wallet.ensdao.eth
# Abstract

Following the passage of [\[Executable\] Collective Working Group Funding Request (Oct 2025)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/77525093718307720477107269225240955392442633055266271196124066559357053541713 "[Executable] Collective Working Group Funding Request (Oct 2025)"), the transactions included in that proposal cannot execute due to insufficient USDC in [wallet.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7 "wallet.ensdao.eth"). This proposal transfers USDC from the ENS Endowment to wallet.ensdao.eth to enable execution of previously approved transfers.

This is an operational treasury action that ensures execution continuity without requiring ETH sales under current market conditions.

This transfer allows the meta-governance working group time to develop improved processes that prevent recurrence.

# Motivation

The proposal \[Executable] Collective Working Group Funding Request (Oct 2025) cannot fully execute because wallet.ensdao.eth lacks sufficient USDC to complete all approved transactions.

The DAO has historically sold ETH to meet USDC-denominated obligations. However, given current market conditions, selling ETH to cover this shortfall is suboptimal. The ENS Endowment holds sufficient USDC reserves to cover near term obligations. An internal transfer avoids unnecessary market impact and preserves treasury flexibility.

This proposal transfers USDC from the Endowment to wallet.ensdao.eth, enabling Collective Working Group Funding Request (Oct 2025) to execute as approved.

**This proposal:**

* &#x20;Enables execution of already approved governance decisions
* Avoids forced ETH sales under unfavorable conditions
* Utilizes existing DAO-controlled capital
* Maintains operational continuity

No new funding program or budget is created.
