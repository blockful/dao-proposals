# [Executable] Set Primary Names for Core DAO Addresses
## Abstract

Several ENS DAO contracts lack primary names. This proposal establishes reverse records for core DAO addresses.

## Motivation

By setting reverse records for core DAO addresses:

* ENS DAO demonstrates best practices by using its own protocol fully, serving as an example for other DAOs
* ENS DAO contracts become easier to identify and navigate
* Names will resolve on sites that list the contracts like [enswallets.xyz](https://www.enswallets.xyz/)

## Details

Executing this proposal will set primary names for

1. The [ENS DAO wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7)
2. The [ENS token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72)
3. The [ENS Endowment wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64)
